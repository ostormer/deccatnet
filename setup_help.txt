Conda installation: 
run 

$conda env create -f environment.yml

$conda activate eeg-ssl-trans

That is all! 

Alternate pip installation without conda:
Set up virtualenv using:

$virtualenv .venv --python="<PATH_TO_PYTHON_EXE>" --system-site-packages

where <PATH_TO_PYTHON_EXE> is the path of your python.exe with pytorch installed. 
In my case it is: "C:\Program Files\Python310\python.exe"

$ .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
(requirements.txt for pip has not been set up as of 2023-02-17)

To run tensorboard when ray tune:
tensorboard --host 0.0.0.0 --logdir=~/repos/master-eeg-trans/tune_results/your tensorboard dir

Tensorboard when no ray_tune is involved:
tensorboard --host 0.0.0.0 --logdir=~/repos/master-eeg-trans/DECCaTNet/runs/your tensorboard di
