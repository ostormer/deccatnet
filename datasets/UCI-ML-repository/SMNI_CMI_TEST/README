			EEG data now publicly available

It is extremely difficult for modelers of nonlinear time series, and
EEG systems in particular, to get access to large sets of raw clean
data.  Such a set of data was acquired and used for the study in
	%A L. Ingber
	%T Statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions: Canonical
	   momenta indicators of electroencephalography
	%J Physical Review E
	%V 55
	%N 4
	%P 4578-4593
	%D 1997

Another paper used a set of out-of-sample data to further test the CMI
developed in the above paper.

The above adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) application to EEG
analysis is one of several ASA applications being prepared for the SPEC
(Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation) CPU98 suite.  Eventually
the code used to perform these calculations will be published on a
CDROM by SPEC.

Raw EEG data is now publicly available, as described in

The ASA code is publicly available at no charge from
